                <p>Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent the most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution and composition of the stars in galaxy trace the history, dynamics and evolution of that galaxy. Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as Carbon, Nitogen and Oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary systems that may coalesce about them. Consequently, the study of the birth, life and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.</p>

                <p>Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A familier example of such as a dust cold is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under it's own gravitational attraction. As the cloud collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is the hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a star. Three dimensional computer model of stars predict that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three blobs. As the cloud collapses, a dense, hot core forms and begins gathering dust and gas. Not all of this material ends up as part of a star; the remaining dust can become planets, asteroids, or comets or may remain as dust.</p>
